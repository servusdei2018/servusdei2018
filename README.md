## 🔭 about me

I speak English natively, and I am in my fourth year of Latin. I love programming, and I know **Python 2/3**, **Go** (my language of choice), **ANSI C**, **JavaScript** (full-stack), and **HTML5/CSS/XML/JSON/YAML**.

I'm enthusiastic about the outdoors, and I love kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and hiking. I love reading many many great books (Aquinas, Aristotle, Plato, Homer, Virgil, Lucretius, Epictetus, Aurelius, Dante, Chaucer, Newton, Pascal, Kant, etc.), and my favorite play is Goethe's *Faust*. O'Neill's *Mourning Becomes Electra* is superb, too.

## 😄 what i do

2 Timothy 1:3
<blockquote>
  I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
</blockquote>

I love 💕 programming a ton of things, especially bots and games. I've made several bots to handle repetitive tasks on a couple MMO's I play, and I've written a couple [MUDs](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) which I'm very proud of!

Right now I am in college, pursuing a Bachelors of Liberal Arts, and hope to pursue a Masters in Computer Science afterwards.

## ⚡ my toolbox
 - Linux (rn my main distro is Ubuntu; I also maintain a Centos 8 server and a Gentoo build). I have a Windows 10 pc too, but just because.
 - Nvim. It is candy.
 - Go. Imma proud gopher :) It's my language of choice.
 - Fullstack JS, web (HTML/CSS)
 - XML, JSON, YAML
 - C99/ANSI C. That's right, there's some neat antiques I mess around with, and I've gained my proficiency therefrom.
