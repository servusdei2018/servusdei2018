# 👉😺👈 hi

hi hi hi my name is Nate 😺, and I'm a ✝️ Roman Catholic ✝️, a ✨ software developer ✨, a chad 🇨🇭 lifeguard 🇨🇭, and and am a 🍔 BK Sensei Guru 🍔. That is, burgers are my blood and sweat. My pronouns are he/him.

## ⚡ about me

I speak English (my native tongue), and a little Spanish. I can read and write Latin, having taken it for three years (Henle). I love programming, and I know **Python 2/3**, **Go** (my language of choice), **ANSI C**, **JavaScript** (full-stack), and **HTML5/CSS/XML/JSON/YAML**.

I'm enthusiastic about the outdoors, and I love kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and hiking. I love reading many many great books (Aquinas, Aristotle, Plato, Homer, Virgil, Lucretius, Epictetus, Aurelius, Dante, Chaucer, Newton, Pascal, Kant, etc.), and my favorite play is Goethe's *Faust*. O'Neill's *Mourning Becomes Electra* is superb, too.

## 😄 what i do

2 Timothy 1:3
<blockquote>
  I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
</blockquote>

I love 💕 programming a ton of things, especially bots and games. I've made several bots to handle repetitive tasks on a couple MMO's I play, and I've written a couple [MUDs](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) which I'm very proud of!

At the time of this writing (14 August 2021) I have two dayjobs, one as a lifeguard and one as a Crew Member at Burger King, and I absolutely love it! I know Front Counter, PC, Main Board, Specialty & Fries, Drinks, Cash, Expo and Prep. I'm very proud of the time I was the only guy working in the kitchen for breakfast one Saturday, and all by myself carried our store to #1 in the district -- and we're one of the busiest restaurants, right off of I-395 and next to three large strip malls.

I am going to college soon (19 August 2021) for Liberal Arts at a wonderful Catholic college, and afterwards am not quite sure what I want to do, although I am considering a CS-related field.

## 🔭 my toolbox
 - Linux (rn my main distro is Ubuntu; I also maintain a Centos 8 and a Gentoo). I have a Windows 10 pc too, but just because.
 - Nvim. It is candy.
 - Go. Imma proud gopher :) It's my language of choice.
 - Fullstack JS, web (HTML/CSS)
 - XML, JSON, YAML
 - C99/ANSI C. That's right, there's some neat antiques I mess around with, and I've gained my proficiency therefrom.
