## 🔭 about me

I'm a little of everything mixed up into me. I love programming, and my forte is **Python 3**, and **Go** (my language of choice). I dabble with **ANSI C**, **JavaScript** (full-stack), and **HTML5/CSS/XML/JSON/YAML**.

I'm enthusiastic about the outdoors, and I love kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and hiking. I love reading many many great books (Aquinas, Aristotle, Plato, Homer, Virgil, Lucretius, Epictetus, Aurelius, Dante, Chaucer, Newton, Pascal, Kant, etc.), and my favorite play is Goethe's *Faust*.

## 😄 what i do

2 Timothy 1:3
<blockquote>
  I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
</blockquote>

I love 💕 programming a ton of things, especially bots. I've made several bots to handle repetitive tasks on a couple MMO's I play, and I've written a couple [MUDs](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) which I'm very proud of!

Right now I am in college, pursuing a BS in Computer Science, and hope to pursue a MSc in Computer Science afterwards.
