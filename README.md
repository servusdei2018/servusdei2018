## 🔭 about me

I'm a little of everything mixed up into one. I love programming, and my forte is **Python**, and **Go**. I'm fluent at fullstack development, with an emphasis on Ionic/Vue.js upfront.

I really love the outdoors. When I'm not working on the next greatest platform, I'm enjoying life on the Quinebaug River, or hiking the trails at a local state park. My dream is to eventually live in the Himalayas.

## 😄 what i do

2 Timothy 1:3
<blockquote>
  I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
</blockquote>

I love 💕 programming a ton of things, especially bots. I've made several bots to handle repetitive tasks on a couple MMO's I play, and I've written a couple [MUDs](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) which I'm very proud of!

Right now I am in college, pursuing a BS in Computer Science, and hope to pursue a MSc in Computer Science afterwards.
